### The perfect developer working environment

> In the beautiful, man sets himself up as the standard of perfection; in select cases he worships himself in it. 
> Man believes that the world itself is filled with beauty -he forgets that it is he who has created it. 
> He alone has bestowed beauty upon the world -alas! only a very human, an all too human, beauty.
>
> Nietzche, F.
